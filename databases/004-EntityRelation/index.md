# ERD

Abstract Data model - Entity Relationship Model
Map out relationships between tables

## Concept
If requirement is RDBMS for Agile ERDs used to design structure of data

All parts of code need to be configured to relate data and how it is managed =/= doesnt mean front end has 3 tables etc.

- What data will be stored
- Who will be accessing the system
- What is data for

- table first modelling
- objects first modelling

## Design types

- Chen Conceptual Model
- UML logical model

Both present the same data, but present it differently

Entity types = tables
Relationships w/ primary and foreign keys
attributes = columns in the tables

(Diagram)

## Exercise 
Create ERD diagrams for your tables
